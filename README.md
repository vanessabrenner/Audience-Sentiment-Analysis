# Audience Sentiment Analysis for Real-Time Adaptation üé≠üìä

## Overview üìù

This project focuses on **real-time audience sentiment analysis** aimed at improving human-computer interaction and enhancing live entertainment experiences. By leveraging advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques, the system can detect emotions in real-time, providing dynamic feedback that adapts to the audience's reactions.

The system integrates robust **face detection** using **Faster R-CNN**, which performs well even in low-light conditions. For emotion recognition, the system combines the power of **MobileNetV2** and a modified **VGG Network**, trained on datasets such as **AffectNet** and **FER2013**. The fusion of MobileNetV2 and a **geometry-based CNN** improves accuracy by combining both global and local facial features.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Real-time Emotion Detection**: Detects and analyzes emotions from facial expressions in real-time.
- **Faster R-CNN**: High-accuracy face detection, even in challenging low-light conditions.
- **MobileNetV2 & Modified VGG Network**: Utilizes advanced neural networks for emotion recognition.
- **Dataset Support**: Trained on the **DARKFACE**, **AffectNet**, and **FER2013** datasets for accurate emotion classification.
- **Fusion Model**: Combines MobileNetV2 with a geometry-based CNN to enhance performance by considering both global and local features.

## Objective üéØ

The goal of this study is to develop a **real-time emotion detection system** that enhances **audience sentiment analysis** and adapts dynamically to the emotions of the audience. The system is built with future improvements in mind, including:
- Broader emotion categories
- Improved occlusion handling
- Adaptive feedback mechanisms
